* Introduction to class
** Syllabus, structure, grading
** Introduce projects and the deadlines
** This actually took a lot of the time, about 35-40 minutes 
** Refer to Dr. Klepmann's book for the slides and the basic content of the class

* Why distributed systems?
** Lamport's definition: "a distributed system is one where the failure of
 a computer you didn't know existed could make your system unusable"
** What is a distributed system? Multiple computers working together over a network to solve a problem. 
** Many reasons: performance, availability, reliability, to solve larger problems

* Talked a little bit about the history of the field
** The theoretical side at PODS and the practical side at conferences like NSDI and SOSP



* Talked about two practical examples of distributed systems having a big impact
** Google figuring how to run massive computations on cheap hardware by developing good distributed systems
** Amazon using the microservices model to turn internal projects into external ones, 
helping it develop services like EC2 and make use of its under-utilized servers
