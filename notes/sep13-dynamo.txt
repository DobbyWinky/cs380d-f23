RECAP
=====
- Bayou, a highly available replicated storage system
- We talked about how Bayou replicates keys, and tentative and stable writes
- We talked about how it gossips the keys, and how it avoids getting keys it has already seen
- We talked about materializing the views, and what is on stable storage

======
- Highly available key-value store from Amazon
- Key ideas: quorums, versions, application-assisted conflict resolution
- Assumptions:
  - Provides ACID properties
  - SLA 99.9th percentile
- Key design points:
  - Incremental scalability
  - Symmetry
  - Decentralization
  - Heterogenity
- Key techniques:
  - Consistent hashing
  - vector clocks
  - sloppy quorum, hinted handoff
  - anti-entropy using merkle trees
  - gossip-based membership
